/*Q) What is oop? List oop concept?

 A)   Object-Oriented Programming (or OOP) is a paradigm of programming in which programs are written and structured around objects rather than functions or logic. 
      Object-Oriented Programming (or OOP) is a paradigm of programming in which programs are written and structured around objects rather than functions or logic. 
      Object procedures can access and modify data in an object.

      There are many OOP languages, with the most popular ones being class-based, where objects will be an instance of a class.
      A class is a container for data and procedures, also known as data members and member functions.

      => Concepts of Oops:
      1. Encapsulation
      2. Abstraction
      3. Inheritance
      4. Polymorphism

   Q) What is the difference between OOP and POP?
   A) Procedure Structured Programming  :
    -> It is a subset of procedural programming. Programs are divided into small programs or functions. 	
    ->It is all about facilitating creation of programs with readable code and reusable components.  	
    ->Its main aim is to improve and increase quality, clarity, and development time of computer program.  	
    ->It simply focuses on functions and processes that usually work on data.  	
    ->It is a method of organizing, managing and coding programs that can give or provide much easier modification and understanding.  	
    ->In this, methods are written globally and code lines are processed one by one i.e., Run sequentially.  	
    ->It generally follows “Top-Down Approach”.  	

    Object-Oriented Programming :
    ->It relies on concept of objects that contain data and code. 
    ->	Programs are divided into objects or entities.
    ->It is all about creating objects that usually contain both functions and data.
    ->Its main aim is to improve and increase both quality and productivity of system analysis and design.
    ->It simply focuses on representing both structure and behavior of information system into tiny or small modules that generally combines data and process both.
    ->It is a method in which set of objects can vary dynamically and can execute just by acting and reading to each other. 
    ->In this, method works dynamically, make calls as per need of code for certain time. 
    ->It generally follows “Bottom-Up Approach”.  
    ->It provides more flexibility and abstraction as compared to structured programming.  
    ->It is less difficult to modify object-oriented programs and reuse code as compared to structured programs.
